This is a stress testing framework for the local cloud (spark-server). It is
a great way to test the stability of your server or cluster of servers.

Features:
* Generate virtual devices - These will register their public keys on your
server and get claimed under a test account.
* Call functions/variables on virtual devices - This will randomly send off
to your cloud which will communicate with your devices.
* Call webhooks on virtual devices - This will randomly call webhooks from the
virtual devices which will hit your cloud.
* Chaos-Monkey - Randomly run webhooks/functions/variables and continuously add
and remove devices.  Use this to really give your server a thrashing.
